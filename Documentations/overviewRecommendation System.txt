It will include several stages starting from 

1. Data Collection and storage 
2. Data Processing and Feature Engineering 
3. Model Training and selections
4. Evaluation
5. Deployement and integration 
6. Monitoring and Maintainance 


1. Data Collection and Storage
---------------------------

a. Data Sources

# User Data 
-User Profiles,browsing history,ratings and reviews

#Product Data
- Product Details, categories, price, descriptions and imagaes of the produt 

#Interaction data
Clicks, views, add-to-cart and purchase transactions

b. Data Storage

* Databases
-SQL : to store structured data /postgreSQL

* Data WareHousing 
- Google BigQery SandBox, Limits: 1TB of quering and 10 GB of storage per month 

* Data Lakes
- Google cloud storage with free tier

c. Data Ingestion:

#ETL Pipelines
- Here we need to automate, extract transform and load the data to the model

#APIS
- Integrate with third-party servicees to gether additional data if necessary 

3. Data Processing and Feature Engineering 

a. Data Cleaning:
- Handle Missing Values
- Remove Duplicates 

b. Feature Engineering
- User Features
- Item Features 
- Interaction Feature

c. Data Transformation 

* Encoding Categorical Variables
- Use techniques like on-hot encoding or label encoding 

*Scaling Numerical Features 
- Apply Normalization and standardization as needed

d. Data Splitting:
- Training validation testing 
(spliting the model to evaluate the model performance)

4. Model Selection and Training 

a Collaborative Filtering:
- User-Based-Collaborative Filtering: Recommend products based on similar users
- Item_based-Collaboration: Recommend products based on similar to items the users has iteracted with.

- Libraries/Tools: scikit-learn, Tensorflow,Pytorch

b. Content-Based Filtering 

-Approach: Recomend products similar to those user had liked in the past based on product feature
-Techniques: Tf-IDF,cosine similarity,neural networks for embedding generation.
-Libraries/Tools: scikit-learn,TensorFlow,Pytorch

c. Hybrid Models

- Combinations of Collaborative and Content_based: Leverage both users interations and product features 
    for recommendations
- Advantages: Improved accuracy and coverage 

d. Advanced Models:

- Matric Factoriazation: Techniques like Singular Value Decomposition
- Deep Learning Models: Neural Collaborative Filtering, Autoencoders.
- Sequential Models: Recurrent Neural Network(RNN) for session-based recommendations.
- Libraries/ Tools: Tensorflow, Pytorch,keras, Implicit

e. Training Steps:

-Choose the Algorithm
- Implement the Model
-Train the Model
- Tune Hyperparameters: Optimize model parameters using techniques like grid search, Bayesian optimizations and optuna.


*****************************************
from surprise import Dataset, Reader, SVD
from surprise.model_selection import cross_validate

# Load data
reader = Reader(rating_scale=(1, 5))
data = Dataset.load_from_df(user_item_df[['user_id', 'item_id', 'rating']], reader)

# Choose algorithm
algo = SVD()

# Evaluate with cross-validation
cross_validate(algo, data, measures=['RMSE', 'MAE'], cv=5, verbose=True)

# Train on full data
trainset = data.build_full_trainset()
algo.fit(trainset)

*****************************************

5. Model Evaluations:

I. Evaluation Metrics:
- Root Mean Square Error(RSME): Measures the difference between predicted and actual ratings.

b. MAE(Mean Absolute Error):
- Average absolute differences between predicted and actual ratings.

c. Precision@k and Recall@k: 
- Measures the accuracy of the top k recommendations 

d. F1 score: Harmonic mean of precision and recall.

e. Coverage: The proportion of items and the system can recommend.

f. Diversity: Variety in the recommended items.

f. Serendipity: Unexpected but relevant recommendations.

II. Validation Techniques:
- Cross Validation: Asses Model Performance across different data splits.

-Train Test Splits: Separate the daya into training and test sets.

III. A/B Testing:
- Real-World Test: Deploy different recommendations models to different user segments and compare performance 

6. Deployement and Integration

a. Model Serving:
- API: Use framework like FLast or FastAPI to create Restfull APIS for serving recommendations.

************************************
from fastapi import FastAPI
import pickle

app = FastAPI()

# Load trained model
with open('recommendation_model.pkl', 'rb') as f:
    model = pickle.load(f)

@app.get("/recommend/{user_id}")
def recommend(user_id: int, top_n: int = 10):
    recommendations = model.get_recommendations(user_id, top_n)
    return {"user_id": user_id, "recommendations": recommendations}

**************************************

b. Containerization 
- Docker: Create a Dockerfile to containerize the model serving API.

****************
FROM python:3.9

WORKDIR /app

COPY requirements.txt .

RUN pip install --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt

COPY . .

CMD ["uvicorn", "main:app", "--host", "0.0.0.0", "--port", "8000"]

****************

c. Hosting:
- Cloud Platforms:Deploye on AWS(EC2,ECS), Google Cloud(App Engine,Kubernetes), Azure
- Serverless Options:AWS Lambda, Google Functions for scalable, on-demand executions.

d. Integration with E-Commerce Platform 
- Front-End_ API Integration: Use AJAX for fetch call to retrive recommendations from the API and display them on the 
website
- Personalizations: Embeded recommendations widgets on homepage,product pages, user, dashboards, etc.

7.Monitoring and Maintainance

a. Monitoring
- Performance Metrics: Track API response times, throughput and error rates.
- Recommendation Quality: Continuously monitor metrics like click through rates(CTR), conversion rate and user engagement 

b. Logging
- Tools: 
Use logging frameworks(python logging module) and centralized logging services(ELK stack Splunk)

c. Model Retraining:
- Scheduled retraining: Set up periodic retraining pipelines to incorporate new data and adapt to changing 
user behaviors.
- Automated Pipelines: Use tools like Apache Airflow or Kubeflow for orchestrating retaining workflows.

d. A/B testing and feedback Loops:
- User Feedbacks: Collect feedbacks to refine recommendation algorithms.
Iterative Improvements: use insights from monitoring and feedback to enhance models.
